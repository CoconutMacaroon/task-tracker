# Task Tracker

## Build from source

> This is how to build it from the source code. If you just want to download it to use it, download the latest version from the [releases section on GitHub](https://github.com/CoconutMacaroon/task-tracker/releases) instead.

I'll assume you have Node.js (and npm) already installed and working, as well as Git.

1. Clone the repo (`git clone https://github.com/CoconutMacaroon/task-tracker`)
2. Install the dependicies with `npm install`
3. Finally, do `npm start` to run it
